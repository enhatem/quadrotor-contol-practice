## 0. Disclaimer
>  1. This guideline may contain some typo and errors.
>  2. Although we use MATLAB to do some dirty works, it is highly recommended to see the behind of the curtain(e.g. how to make the controllability matrix, Ackermann's formula, Drawing Bode plot, etc.).  
>  3. There may several other manageable approaches, solutions, and answers to a single problem(e.g. ways of system stability proof, gains or pole locations in feedback controller designs, etc.).
>  Therefore, all reasonable solutions may take full credits.
>  IN OTHER WORDS, HOWEVER, THIS ALSO MEANS GIVING THE SAME ANSWERS ON THE PROBLEMS [2d], [4b], [4c], and [4d] CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A SUSPICIOUS ACT BETWEEN STUDENTS, AND NEED JUSTIFICATION TO TAKE FULL SCORES.
> 4. If you run into any troubles regarding the assignment #1 (error reporting, claims, etc.), ask T.A. in charge for the help. Assistant: Seongheon Lee (skynspace@kaist.ac.kr)

## 2. State-Space Control Analysis
### &nbsp; Given an inverted pendulum (neglect the mass and inertia of a bar) on a cart, (linearlized) mathematical model of the system can be described as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Ml\ddot{\theta} &=(M+m)g\theta-u &(2.1)\\
M\ddot{x} &= u - mg\theta &(2.2)
\end{aligned}
$$

<p align="center"><img class="pull-left" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Htn6qAjoYKbAc3EmNCylbn61zgcCJclLLNMjqAuUpgmSNrZdDRhIPcv9zv6ECmbqYMZB7VNfBGY=s300"></img> <br> <em>Figure1. Inverted Pendulum on a Cart</em></p>
### &nbsp; Please answer to the following questions when the system parameters are given to be;
$$
M = 2kg,\quad m = 0.1kg,\quad  l = 0.5m,\quad g=9.81m/s^2.
$$


### [2a]. Derive a state-space equation of the form $\bold{\dot{x}}=\bold{Ax}+\bold{B}u$, where state variable $\bold{x}=[\theta, \dot{\theta}, x, \dot{x}]^T$. (5pts.)

&nbsp; Since $\bold{\dot{x}}=[\dot{\theta}, \ddot{\theta}, \dot{x}, \ddot{x}]^T$, rearranging equation (2.1), and (2.2) yields,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\theta}=&1\cdot{\dot{\theta}}&(2a.1)&\\
\ddot{\theta}=&{{(M+m)g}\over{Ml}}\cdot{\theta}-{{1}\over{Ml}}\cdot{u} &(2a.2)&\\
\dot{x}=&1\cdot{\dot{x}}&(2a.3)&\\
\ddot{x}=&-{{mg}\over{M}}\cdot{\theta}+{{1}\over{M}}\cdot{u}&.(2a.4)&
\end{aligned}
$$
&nbsp; Organizing (2a.1)-(2a.4) into a matrix form yields,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{\theta} \\ \ddot{\theta} \\ \dot{x} \\ \ddot{x}
\end{bmatrix} =&
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
{{(M+m)g}\over{Ml}} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
-{mg}\over{M} & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
{\theta} \\ \dot{\theta} \\ x \\ \dot{x}
\end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ -{{1}\over{Ml}} \\ 0 \\ {1}\over{M}
\end{bmatrix} u &.(2a.5)&
\end{aligned}
$$
&nbsp; Lastly, putting the system parameters into (2a.5) completes the form:
$$
\begin{aligned}
A =&
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
20.601 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
-0.4905 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0.5
\end{bmatrix} &.(2a.6)&

### [2b]. Give an analysis of the stability of the system. (5pts.)
&nbsp; One way to check the stability of a system from a given state-space equation is calculating eigenvalues of the A matrix. In MATLAB, you can use eig(A) to produce the eigenvalues of a square matrix A.
```

### [2c]. Give an analysis of the controllability of the system if you can access to the full state of the system. (10pts.)
&nbsp; The easiest way of checking the controllabililty of the given system is to check the full rank of a controllability matrix(our system has the dynamics matrix with the dimension of $n=4$, and input matrix dimension of $m=1$).
$$
M_C=[B \ |\  AB \ |\  A^2B \ |\  \cdots \ |\  A^{n-1}B] \\
(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}, \ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}) 
$$
&nbsp; Building and checking the rank of controllability can be done in a single line.

```
% SCRIPT
rank(ctrb(A,B))
```
```
% OUTPUTS
ans =

     4
```
&nbsp; Since the controllability matrix has the full rank, our system is controllable (ONLY WITH A SINGLE INPUT)!

### [2d]. Design a full-state feedback controller(regulator) with the form of $u=-\bold{Kx}$ if the system is controllable. If not, describe the necessary conditions to be controllable. (10pts.)

&nbsp; We want to use the input $u$ to modify the unstable eigenvalues of $A$ to change the system dynamics.
Since we assumed a full-state feedback, $u$ has the form of $u=r-\bold{Kx}$, where $r$ is some reference input and the gain $\bold{K}$ is in $\mathbb{R}^{1\times n}$. When $r=0$, we call this controller a regulator.
<p align="center"><img class="pull-left" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fmb6Na_TOmHgiFR-4ofH-AZf5xhnOpZwfDIiMQT1g8cTqNcpxLF4vP-YWETOQP3WnyVGm7hA3Aem=s300"></img> <br> <em>Full-state feedback control</em></p>
&nbsp; Therefore the closed-loop dynamics can be described as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bold{\dot{x}}=&\bold{Ax}+\bold{B}u =\bold{Ax}+\bold{B}(r-\bold{Kx})\\
=&(\bold{A}-\bold{BK})\bold{x}+\bold{B}r \\
=&\bold{A_{_{cl}}x}+\bold{B}r \\
y=&\bold{Cx}=\bold{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

&nbsp; Now, our objective can be explained as follows:
- We want to make $\bold{A_{cl}}$ stable although $\bold{A}$ is unstable.
- Pick $\bold{K}$ such that $\bold{A_{cl}}$ has the desired properties.
- Put the poles of $\bold{A_{cl}}$ at the desired locations. 

&nbsp; One may solve the $det(sI-\bold{A_{cl}})=0$ to put eigenvlaues anywhere in the left half of the complex plane (assuming complex conjugate pairs of poles), a MATLAB function 
```
>> K=acker(A,B,P) % P: Desired Pole locations.
```
gives us a method of doing this entire design process in one single step. (cf. Ackermann's Formula)

&nbsp; For example, one can design the controller $\bold{K}$ that makes $\bold{A_{cl}}$ to take $-5, -6, -7, -8$ as pole locations:
```
% SCRIPT
P = [-5 -6 -7 -8];
K = acker(A,B,P)
A_cl = A-B*K;

C = eye(4);
D = 0;

sys_cl = ss(A_cl,B,C,D);
figure(1)
step(sys_cl); grid on;
```
```

K =

## 3. Frequency Response Control Analysis

### &nbsp; Consider a feedback system composed of a plant of $P(s)={100\over s}$ , and a controller of $C(s)={100\over {s+40}}$
<p align="center"><img class="pull-left" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7Ge3G1BIDDZrR8ezlMEbGvhTRKZf7-cZTsPMVXtHEg3LUUy7dTKCR7nRGtZudiHE8v_Z4MnBwy8=s600"></img> <br> <em>Figure2. Feedback Control Loop</em></p>

```

C = tf([100],[1 40])    % 100/(s+40)
```

### [3a]. Draw the Bode plots of the loop transfer function (i.e., $L(s)=P(s)C(s)$).

&nbsp; In this polt, the number of unstable open-loop poles is zero ($P = 0$), the number of clockwise encirclement of (-1) is also zero ($N=0$). Therefore, the number of unstable closed-loop poles is $Z=P+N=0$, which means the closed-loop stability is garunteed.

    G = tf([1],[1 0 0]);    % 1/s^2
    C = tf([1 1],[1 p(i)]); % (s+1)/(s+p)
    subplot(2,3,i)
    rlocus(G*C); grid on;
    title(['p = ' num2str(p(i)) ''])

&nbsp; To design a lead compensator, one should grasp the tendency due to the different pole placement strategies. In the figure above, we can see three different tendencies with repect to the pole locations (e.g. $p=1$, $1<p<9$, and $p \geq 9$).

### [4b]. Select values of $p$ and $k$ to make the closed-loop step response satisfies the following conditions. (10pts.)
- Overshoot < 16.3[%],
- 2% Settling Time < 1.667[sec]

&nbsp; From [4b] to [4d], we can use MATLAB sisotool to find the satisfactory $p$ and $k$ conditions.
&nbsp; One can start from the scratch and put the design requirements on the root locus and step response: 
```
% SCRIPT
G = tf([1],[1 0 0]);  % 1/s^2
C = tf([1 1],[1 20]); % (s+1)/(s+20)
sisotool(G, C);
```
&nbsp; Or start from the saved file in [https://github.com/SKYnSPACE/AE450HW1](https://github.com/SKYnSPACE/AE450HW1) containing all the design requirements: 
```
% SCRIPT
sisotool('HW1_Prob4.mat');
```
&nbsp; Drag around the poles (square box) on the interactive root locus editor, and see whether the step response is within the boundary. For example, I choosed $k=372.67$, $p=30$ in the saved 'mat' file.

### [4e]. Discuss on the steady-state error characteristics when the $r(t)$ is a unit ramp input (i.e., $r(t) = t$ for $t>=0$, and $r(t) = 0$ for $t<0$). (5pts.)

&nbsp; The transfer function from $r$ to $y$ can be described as follows (look for the problem [3d] if you need the detailed explanation):
$$
{{Y(s)}\over{R(s)}} = {{ks+1}\over{s^3+ps^2+ks+k}}
$$

&nbsp; For the ramp input, $R(s)=\mathcal{L}(r(t))={{1}\over{s^2}}$. Putting this into the above equation yields;
$$
Y(s) = {{ks+1}\over{(s^3+ps^2+ks+k)\cdot s^2 } \ .}
$$

&nbsp; Therefore, the error signal can be expressed as
$$
E(s) = R(s) - Y(s) = \left( 1-{{ks+1}\over{(s^3+ps^2+ks+k)}} \right) \cdot {{1}\over{s^2}} = {{s^2(s+p)}\over{s^3+ps^2+ks+k}}\cdot {{1}\over{s^2}} \ .
$$

&nbsp; Lastly, the final value theorem gives the steady-state error characteristics as follows:
$$
\lim_{t \to \infin}e(t)= \lim_{s \to 0}s \cdot E(s)=0
$$
$\therefore$ We can expect the zero steady-state error.
